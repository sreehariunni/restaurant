api call in js
----------------------


AJAX
-Xmlhttp
-fetch
-asynch & await
 we use useEffect insted of ngOnInit


 redirection in react
 -----------------------
npm i react-router-dom

import {
     BrowserRouter as Router - all routing need components
     ,Routes                 - to set path for each component
     ,Route                  - morethan one path
     } from 'react-router-dom';


useParams - hook used to access params from component url


REDUX
---------
coupling  - many cnctions between parent and child component

props drilling   - in co if any intermediate componenthave eny errors all other
                   chids will not work

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

for this react introduces a new thechnology  - state management technology  - REDUX


redux proces
-------------
create a new js file to keep the states, all the components can access the js file

-the components can access the datas from the js file but can't update datas in js file

-Action   -> a file with all logics to update the state
-Dispatch -> method used to Dispatch the logic in action file when the component need updation
-Reducer  -> update the datas in js file according to the payload responce get from action file

libraries to apply redux
--------------------------
1.REDUX
2.REACT-REDUX
3.REDUX-THUNK

for instalation - npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk


createStore() - a method used to create store in js file 
                 -2  args
                 -1- reducer   
                 -2- middleware  (used to make synchronous redux into asynchonous)

applyMiddleware()  - method in REDUX to apply middleware.

combineReducers()  - method in REDUX used to combine all the redcuers in js file


thunk  - used to create middleware 


1.create store
2.apply the store in index.js      
   provider is an tag used to pass the store (react-redux)

   AXIOS  - module used to make http methods(api call)
             npm i axios 


useDispatch - hook used to dispatch actions in components - react-redux



to access datas from store to components - useSelector -hook
